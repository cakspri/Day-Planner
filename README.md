# 05 : Day-Planner

## Task

The task this week is to create a simple calendar application by modifying starter code that will use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library and will allow a user to select their start time for a work day and save events/tasks/todo's for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule I WANT to add important events to a daily planner SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
‚úì WHEN I open the planner THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
‚úì WHEN I scroll down THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
‚úì WHEN I view the time blocks for that day THEN each time block is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
‚úì WHEN I click into a time block THEN I can enter an event
‚úì WHEN I click the save button for that time block THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
‚úì WHEN I refresh the page THEN the saved events persist
```
